# MongoDB

This is a basic Node.js script that connects to MongoDB.

## Getting Started

1. Use the MongoDB extension from the left-hand sidebar to connect to the local database instance â€” `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
2. Open `index.js` to view the implementation.

## Roles

I was unable to retrieve the list of roles because the project is not running. Once the project is running, you can find the list of roles by making a GET request to `/api/roles`.

Here are the available roles:

* **[Role 1]**
* **[Role 2]**
* **[Role 3]**

**Note:** Please replace the bracketed roles with the actual roles from your application.
